## I'm a motivated Web Developer and Tech Enthusiast. 

I help businesses to grow their online presence by having modern and up-to-date websites. 

I enjoy building websites and web applications with HTML,CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress. Having a strong emphasis on Next.Js and React.Js.

I volunteered at Jed Child Trust Foundation a non-profit organization which is centred on improving the quality of education for Africa children in rural and suburban areas, promoting and providing them with high-quality education.
